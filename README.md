# BugFix Lab

A collection of Python scripts with common bugs, alongside fixed versions and explanations. 

## What this project shows:
- Debugging skills and problem-solving
- Clear communication and documentation
- Python best practices

## How to use:
- Explore `broken_code` for buggy examples
- Check `fixed_code` for working versions
- Read `explanations.md` for detailed fixes

Feel free to use these examples to learn or share with clients to showcase my skills!
